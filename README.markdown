MouseEventListener
======

MouseEventListener adds two new callbacks to Sublime Text 2's plugin API:

* `on_pre_click({'event': {'x': screen_x, 'y': screen_y, 'button': button}})`
* `on_post_click(text_point)`

An important thing to note is that the selection is modified not once but twice in between on_pre_click and on_post_clickâ€”this is done to determine the text_point of the click, as Sublime Text 2 has no API to translate a screen x and y into a text_point other than by calling "drag_select" and seeing where the selection ends up.

Install
-------

This plugin is available through Package Control, which is available here:

    http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control

As far as I know, Package Control does not handle dependencies, so if you depend on this package you may have to mention installing it in your install instructions.
